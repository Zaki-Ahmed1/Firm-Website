      <SectionTitle>The Benefits of Utilizing Marine CNG Transport Solutions</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText className="mt-3">
        Natural gas is usually stored and transported in compressed form, that is, compressed
        natural gas (CNG). Examples of CNG include high pressure transmission pipelines, medium and
        low pressure distribution and utility pipelines, underground and above ground storage
        facilities and small volume, high pressure fuel tanks. Designs and procedures for handling
        natural gas in compressed form have existed for over 100 years, and with the expanded use of
        natural gas in everyday life: industry, communities and transportation, these well-proven
        technologies and designs continue to be expanded and improved upon. This progress is
        illustrated by the rapid growth in natural gas vehicles around the world, which is based on
        the use of small volume CNG storage containers in cars, buses and trucks. This application
        of CNG has proven to be safe and reliable and accepted by communities and regulators. The
        International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles (IANGV) is projecting that 50 million CNG
        vehicles will be on the roads by 2020.

      <SectionTitle>Marine Transport of CNG – Proven Technology</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText>
        Given this background, it was logical that technology would be advanced for transporting
        large volumes of natural gas as CNG on the seas, just as liquid petroleum and petrochemicals
        have been shipped for decades in large volume tankers. In the late 1960s, Columbia Gas
        Company developed a CNG containment system aboard a converted ship. This prototype vessel
        was awarded class certification by the American Bureau of Shipping and received approval
        from the U.S. Coast Guard for operations in U.S. waters. After about a dozen successful
        voyages, which proved the CNG marine transport concept, operations ceased due to the low
        value of natural gas at that time. In addition to these previous CNG ship operations,
        natural gas components, such as propane, butane and various LPG mixes, are commonly shipped
        today in pressurized and chilled storage systems aboard barges and tanker ships.

      <SectionTitle>EnerSea Marine CNG</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText>
        EnerSea began its quest to develop a modern CNG marine transport system in 2001 with the
        development of its VOTRANS (Volume Optimized Transport and Storage system) technology and
        designs. The VOTRANS system introduced a major breakthrough in the ability to store and
        deliver compressed natural gas on marine vessels cost effectively. Much more gas can be
        stored in and delivered from VOTRANS containment systems, and at a correspondingly lower
        cost, than with previous CNG design approaches. EnerSea has undertaken an intensive
        development program to commercialize this technology through engineering, validation,
        certification and application efforts. The results of these labors are EnerSea ship and
        barge-based CNG systems for which ABS has declared “…are ready to move directly into project
        construction” and that “ABS will approve EnerSea ships and barges built with VOTRANS CNG
        systems.”

      <SectionTitle>Application of EnerSea CNG Marine Transport Systems</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText>
        CNG marine transport can provide ideal solutions for a wide variety of regional
        applications, including:
        <ul>
          <li>To markets located beyond pipeline reach and less than about 3000 kms</li>
          <li>
            For supply sources not large enough to justify the high capital investment required for
            LNG projects
          </li>
          <li>
            To offtake gas directly from offshore production facilities, including in deep and
            ultra-deep waters
          </li>
          <li>To replace fuel oil and diesel with natural gas in “stranded” markets</li>
          <li>To offtake the associated gas from oil production fields</li>
          <li>
            To produce and transport gas from extended oil well tests and early production systems
          </li>
          <li>
            To serve as an “all-in-one” gas production host and transport system for remote fields
          </li>

      <SectionTitle>Comparison of CNG with LNG Supply Chain</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText>
        CNG is often compared with LNG, as both are large volume, marine-based gas transport
        solutions. However, these two technologies typically target different sectors of both supply
        sources and energy markets. In summary, the major differences include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Capital Investment: CNG projects do not require massively expensive liquefaction and
            regasification plants. Thus, the overall supply chain project is typically an order of
            magnitude less expensive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Footprint and environmental impact is much less for CNG terminals than for LNG
            terminals.
          </li>
          <li>
            LNG often requires expensive pre-processing of the supply gas to a much higher degree
            than required for CNG to remove components such as mercury and CO2.
          </li>
          <li>
            CNG does not experience “boil off” gas emissions from ships and storage facilities.
          </li>
          <li>CNG is typically more energy efficient than LNG.</li>
          <li>
            In summary, CNG targets small-to-medium sized regional gas delivery projects, while LNG
            must be geared toward large scale, long haul projects.

      <SectionTitle>Marine CNG – A Unique Project Management Tool</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText>
        In addition to providing a cost-effective regional gas development solution in itself, CNG
        marine transport projects also offer several unique and valuable features for flexibility
        and risk management:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easy Supply and Market Access: The terminals needed for loading and offloading vessels
            are simple in design, highly cost- effective (especially compared with LNG liquefaction
            and regasification facilities), and friendly in their physical footprint and environment
            benefits. Therefore, CNG may access supply sites and sensitive markets more easily than
            other marine-based solutions, such as LNG.
          </li>
          <li>
            Redeployability: Unlike pipelines and LNG projects, the great majority of CNG project
            capital is redeployable to other applications if needed. This provides a unique risk
            management solution in case unexpected events occur in the supply chain, including
            reservoir, market, commercial and political risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scalability: CNG project capacity is easily scalable by adding vessels to, or
            redeploying vessels from, the fleet. Therefore, unlike pipelines, upfront investment in
            capital for speculative capacity is not required, but instead can be employed at the
            time when such additional capacity may be required. With the above risk management and
            flexibility features, CNG projects may be able to secure more attractive financing and
            yield higher “risk-weighted” value to project stakeholders.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <SectionTitle>Safety and Environmental Benefits</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Air quality: CNG delivered to markets to replace fuels such as coal, fuel oil and diesel
            will significantly reduce CO2 and other emissions; potentially valuable emissions
            credits may be available in such projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Project emissions: CNG has no “boil-off” losses; the use of cargo gas for marine fuel
            also mitigates bunker use and storage in the shipping operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            CNG terminals have a modest physical footprint and environmental impact to the terminal
            area.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cargo transfer buoy terminals can be located 5-20 kms from the coast for offshore
            loading and offloading of CNG vessels in highly sensitive areas.
          </li>
