          Because of its capital intensiveness, LNG is only cost-effective with very large scale
          projects, with correspondingly large reserve sizes and markets. The transit distance
          crossover point between LNG and CNG varies depending on the type of project, reservoir
          size, market size and economic drivers of both the supplier and the market. However, in
          general the economics of LNG will crossover with CNG somewhere around 2500 kilometers
          assuming a very large reservoir (3-5+ TCF) and correspondingly large gas flow rates.

        CNG Technology Alternatives Traditional Methods LNG Because of its capital intensiveness,
        LNG is only cost-effective with very large scale projects, with correspondingly large
        reserve sizes and markets. The transit distance crossover point between LNG and CNG varies
        depending on the type of project, reservoir size, market size and economic drivers of both
        the supplier and the market. However, in general the economics of LNG will crossover with
        CNG somewhere around 2500 kilometers assuming a very large reservoir (3-5+ TCF) and
        correspondingly large gas flow rates. Advantages for Stranded Gas Development CNG projects
        have much shorter development timelines than LNG, resulting in a dramatic increase in net
        present value when compared to green field LNG projects. LNG projects require enormous
        amounts of capital invested in fixed facilities – typically over 60% of the overall LNG
        project cost. EnerSea’s VOTRANS™ technology is designed to have less than 15% of its total
        capital costs invested in fixed facilities. The vast majority of capital tied up in an
        EnerSea project is in the vessels that are re-deployable. Accordingly, VOTRANS has the
        potential flexibility to accommodate smaller projects in applications that have higher risk
        issues and can also take advantage of changing market opportunities. In order to confirm
        reserves large enough for LNG projects, producers face high appraisal and development costs,
        schedule and risks. VOTRANS’ ability to lower development risk by initiating earlier cash
        flows with smaller proven reserves can provide an attractive complement to potential LNG
        projects. If the project reservoir subsequently proves substantial enough for LNG, then the
        producer can utilize VOTRANS until the LNG trains are constructed and then re-deploy the
        VOTRANS vessels to another project. Otherwise, the producer can profitably produce the
        smaller reserve base using VOTRANS and will have managed his risk by doing so.

        <b>Pipelines</b>
        <br />
        EnerSea’s VOTRANS technology is cost competitive when compared to deepwater or long-distance
        pipelines. Further, pipelines offer no option for redeployment. Even though pipelines are
        well-established solutions for gas developments, there are advantages that CNG has over
        pipelines for stranded gas developments, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>
            CNG is scalable and can be expanded or scaled back based on field development
            objectives.
          </li>
          <li>
            CNG systems are re-deployable, which allows application for shorter field depletions.

          <li>CNG costs are independent of water depth.</li>

        <b>FLNG</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Many operators are now investigating small-scale floating LNG, or FLNG. EnerSea has
        developed a floating gas production solution that addresses the challenges operators are
        facing by advancing the development of its VOTRANS compressed natural gas (CNG) carrier into
        an all-in-one gas production and transport system called GPSS (Gas Production Storage
        Shuttle). The GPSS is analogous to an FPSO used in oil service in all environments worldwide
        with the added capability of transporting its gas product to market. EnerSea’s CNG solution,
        which allows production, storage and transportation, provides significant advantages over
        FLNG:
        <HeroImage src="./cngtechlink3ref2.png" />
        <br />
        <p>
          Many aspects of FLNG are unproven, such as offshore liquefaction and tanker-tanker cargo
          transfer systems. FLNG also requires separate facilities (e.g. FPSO) for cleaning and
          pre-processing of raw gas well stream required for LNG. Additionally, due to the tall
          towers required for FLNG pre-processing and the offloading methods, it will be very
          challenging to design and operate an FLNG system offshore in harsh environments without
          significant uptime penalties. Additional advantages of an FPSO, such as risk management
          and re-deployability, also apply to the GPSS.

        Benefits of VOTRANS vs. High-Pressure CNG Technology
        <p>VOTRANS has many advantages over alternative High-Pressure CNG technology, including:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Storage Efficiency: Alternative efforts by EnerSea competitors to develop high-pressure
            CNG concepts all store gas at ambient temperature (approx 15 - 25C) and pressures in
            excess of 235 bar (3400 psi), which requires pressure vessel designs having much greater
            wall thicknesses or supplemental fiberglass wrapping with corresponding higher weight
            and much greater cost. EnerSeaslower pressure approach ensures that VOTRANS steel
            cylinders are also the lightest containment option available to store a given volume of
            gas, even when compared to fiberglass or hybrid tanks. Compared with other CNG
            technology, VOTRANS can store 60% more gas (mass) per pound of steel due to the
            optimization of pressure and temperature. This efficiency would enable EnerSea to carry
            carry the same gas volume per ship at a lower cost per unit. As a result, VOTRANS-based
            transportation costs are as much as 30% less than other High-Pressure CNG alternatives
          </li>
          <li>
            Gas Handling System: EnerSea patented liquid displacement system used for unloading gas
            allows the evacuation and delivery of up to 98% of its gas cargo versus only 85-90% for
            blowdown systems. Therefore, High-Pressure CNG competitors must build ships that have
            10-15% larger sotrage capacity than a VOTRANS ship simply to deliver the same gas
            volume.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cold Temperature Cycling: Another advantage of EnerSea patented liquid displacement
            system is enhanced safety. High-Pressure CNG alternatives require expansion to occur
            within their cargo containment system, subjecting the cargo systems to large temperature
            and pressure variations. EnerSea liquid displacement process allows the temperature drop
            associated with expansion of the gas to occur outside the storage containment system, at
            a control point (similar to J-T valves in gas plants), thereby protecting the
            containment system from potentially damaging, severe and repetitive cycles in
            temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Range of Gas Compositions: EnerSea VOTRANS technology is designed to maintain control of
            pressure and temperature during unloading operations which allows the transport of rich
            gas as well as lean gas. Expansion and subsequent temperature drop during offloading
            within High-Pressure CNG systems causes natural gas liquids to drop out of the vapor
            phase in the contaiunment system, creating potentially undesirable slug flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Low Pressures: VOTRANS is designed to operate at a pressure of approximately 125 bar,
            compared to 235+ bar for High-Pressure CNG systems, which results in less compression
            requirements on clients platforms and significantly less capital and operating costs
            compression facilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Energy and Facilities: Compression and gas cooling are required for both VOTRANS and
            High-Pressure CNG systems and the energy required for both are approximately equal.
            However, the energy split between compression and chilling for VOTRANS is about 50/50,
            while High-Pressure CNG is about 90/10. EnerSea primary benefit is that utilization of
            this volume optimization principle results in a signifiant reduction in steel weight and
            resultant cost savings. Additionally, EnerSea offloading system consists primarily of
            liquid pumps, which are easy to maintain and low cost as compared to scavenging gas
            compression required for High-Pressure CNG alternatives.
