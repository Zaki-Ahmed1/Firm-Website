      <SectionTitle>The best cost-effective CNG technology on the market</SectionTitle>
      <SectionText className="mt-3">
        EnerSea’s VOTRANS™ system is the world’s first cost-effective marine gas transport service
        since the introduction of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The VOTRANS™ (and VOLANDS™ for
        land-based storage) CNG system employs the next generation applications of proven
        technologies that allow significantly more gas to be stored and efficiently handled compared
        to other CNG technologies.

        VOTRANS™ is the most versatile and efficient system available for the marine transportation
        of natural gas, which can deliver volumes of 25 to 1,000 million standard cubic feet (MMscf)
        per ship at significantly lower costs than other gas transportation alternatives. The
        VOTRANS™ system creates advantages not available in other CNG technologies by optimizing the
        relationships between storage pressure, temperature and the structural capabilities of
        commercially available, high-strength carbon steel pipe. Furthermore, VOTRANS™ employs a
        proven but innovative approach to gas handling that can accommodate a wide range of gas
        compositions and enables efficient transfer between transport and storage facilities by
        minimizing the “heel” gas left over. VOTRANS™ delivers the best steel-to-gas weight ratio
        for the most economic CNG marine gas delivery system available in the industry.

        EnerSea owns a suite of patents in the United States and around the world along with
        proprietary know-how relating to its gas storage and handling systems. EnerSea has completed
        extensive and rigorous engineering, testing and validation programs in partnership with
        large engineering, construction and oil & gas companies, to design and certify its CNG
        systems. It has obtained approval-in-principle from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)
        and Det Norske Veritas-GL (DNV), confirming that VOTRANS™ is ready for project execution.

        VOTRANS is more cost-effective due to:
        <ul>
          <li>Greater gas storage efficiency – VOTRANS Gas Containment</li>
          <li>Greater gas delivery efficiency – VOTRANS Gas Handling System</li>
        </ul>
      </SectionText>
      <SectionText>
        VOTRANS project systems use proven components and equipment:
        <ul>
          <li>CNG Ships for large volume, long distance projects</li>
          <li>CNG Barges for small volume, short distance projects</li>
          <li>CNG Ports and terminals for onshore or offshore</li>
          <li>CNG Storage can be provided for optimized ship utilization</li>
        </ul>
      </SectionText>
      <SectionText>VOTRANS is patented, tested and approved.</SectionText>
      <SectionText>
        VOTRANS systems have been developed to be:
        <ul>
          <li>Safe</li>
          <li>Reliable</li>
        </ul>
      </SectionText>
      <SectionText>
        VOTRANS has many advantages over the alternatives:
        <ul>
          <li>Non-CNG Technologies (LNG, FLNG, Pipelines)</li>
          <li>High-Pressure CNG Technologies</li>
        </ul>
